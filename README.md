# ab-analysis-framework-beta

Source repository for two Mira skills that work together:

- `ab-analysis-framework-beta`
  - analysis skill for experiment reading, attribution, and decision support
- `ab-knowledge-builder-beta`
  - knowledge-builder skill for glossary / KB ingestion, normalization, and live knowledge maintenance

This repo is meant to be used as a paired setup:
- the builder skill seeds and maintains the live knowledge store under `userdata/ab-analysis-framework-beta/*`
- the framework skill reads that knowledge store and applies the analysis schema

---

## Quick Start | 快速开始

### Step 1. Download these two packages

- [Download `ab-knowledge-builder-beta.zip`](https://github.com/cuican1432/ab-analysis-framework-beta/raw/main/release/ab-knowledge-builder-beta.zip)
- [Download `ab-analysis-framework-beta.zip`](https://github.com/cuican1432/ab-analysis-framework-beta/raw/main/release/ab-analysis-framework-beta.zip)

Do not use the GitHub auto-generated source zip from the repo page.

### Step 2. Install the two packages in Mira

1. Open `Mira`
2. Open `Skills`
3. Open `Manage Skills`
4. Upload `ab-knowledge-builder-beta.zip`
5. Wait until the first upload finishes
6. Upload `ab-analysis-framework-beta.zip`
7. Wait until the second upload finishes

Install them in this order:
- upload the knowledge-builder package first
- then upload the analysis framework package

### Step 3. Why this order matters
- the builder package ships seeded social KB / glossary content inside `userdata/ab-analysis-framework-beta/*`
- the framework package can then read that knowledge layer immediately

### Step 4. What success looks like after upload
- `SKILL.md` at zip root
- `references/`, `userdata/`, and package files at the same root level

## Quick Smoke Test | 快速烟测

If you want to quickly verify that the framework really works, use one of these public smoke test cases first:

- `Personalized Bubble / 个性化气泡`
  - Raw Data: [Lark Raw Data Doc](https://bytedance.larkoffice.com/docx/L2kwdjvt5oLCwsxbB7Wc6uMRnud)
  - PRD: [Lark PRD](https://bytedance.larkoffice.com/wiki/BT70wFcLAi5eh3k2ihJc4LCynWe)

- `DM Card UI Optimization / 私信卡片 UI 优化`
  - Raw Data: [Lark Raw Data Doc](https://bytedance.larkoffice.com/docx/GTtkd0Ixnos3VExjttecsuKEnxp)
  - PRD: [Lark PRD](https://bytedance.sg.larkoffice.com/docx/GNMUdHluloFyw3xeaSklIAaSgee)

The simplest validation flow is:

1. Install the two skills above.
2. In your Mira conversation, reference `ab-analysis-framework-beta`.
3. Pass the `PRD` link and `Raw Data` link directly into the skill.
4. Check whether it can follow the doc-first path and produce a structured experiment report.

One hard rule for smoke tests:
- always reread the source from the current links
- do not reuse historical files, old reports, or prior intermediate outputs

## What Each Skill Is For | 两个 Skill 分别做什么

### 1. `ab-analysis-framework-beta`

Use this when the main job is:
- generating an experiment report
- reading PRD + raw data together in order to write the report
- applying the stored glossary / KB during that report-writing workflow

Typical use cases:
- A/B 实验观测结束，需要输出实验报告
- 已经有 PRD 和 raw data，想直接写实验报告

Example prompts:
- `Please use ab-analysis-framework-beta to generate an experiment report.`
- `Please use ab-analysis-framework-beta to analyze this PRD and raw data together.`

### Usage Guide | 使用指南

#### Scenario 1. Write an experiment report

Use this when:
- the experiment observation window has ended
- the data is ready
- you want the skill to read the PRD and raw data together, then write the report

You can say:

```text
Please use ab-analysis-framework-beta to generate an experiment report.
Experiment name (optional): [example: DM Personalized Bubble]
PRD link: [URL]
Raw Data link: [URL]
```

What the system will do:
- run the doc-first analysis flow
- silently read the stored glossary and KB first
- use the existing analysis rules and report schema
- output a structured experiment report instead of scattered notes

### 2. `ab-knowledge-builder-beta`

Use this when the main job is:
- building or updating the glossary
- building or updating KB topics
- migrating knowledge into the live store
- normalizing metric meaning / polarity / caliber / priority
- maintaining indexes and reading guides

Typical use cases:
- 想把新整理的指标定义沉淀到知识库
- 想把一批 KB 文档整理进 live knowledge store
- 想统一某个 metric group 的含义、priority、caliber

Example prompts:
- `Please use ab-knowledge-builder-beta to ingest these metric definitions into the glossary, including metric meaning, aliases, polarity, and calculation notes.`
- `Please use ab-knowledge-builder-beta to update the DM knowledge base with this new source and extract reusable product-mechanism knowledge.`
- `Please use ab-knowledge-builder-beta to normalize this metric group, including group meaning, business domain, priority, scope, and typical usage.`
- `Please use ab-knowledge-builder-beta to normalize these metric meanings and caliber tags, such as uv/au, days/days, days/user, pv/user, and ratio.`

## Package Layout | 包结构

Each installable package is built so that:
- `SKILL.md` is at the zip root
- `README.md`, `references/`, and `userdata/` are at the same zip-root level

Current packaged files:
- `release/ab-analysis-framework-beta.zip`
- `release/ab-knowledge-builder-beta.zip`

---

## Layering Model | 分层模型

### `references/core/*`

Hard analysis layer:
- workflow
- rules
- runbook
- memory / tooling guidance

### `references/knowledge/*`

Reading layer:
- indexes
- guides
- interpretation patterns
- stable examples
- migration-time references

This layer tells the skills:
- how to read knowledge
- how to navigate knowledge
- how to interpret common patterns

### `userdata/ab-analysis-framework-beta/*`

Live knowledge layer:
- actual glossary content
- actual KB content
- custom rules
- continuously updated local knowledge

This is the layer that should keep growing over time.

## Current Live Knowledge Root | 当前 live knowledge 根目录

```text
userdata/ab-analysis-framework-beta/
├── glossary/
│   ├── metric_groups.md
│   ├── metric_groups_table.md
│   ├── dimensions.md
│   ├── dimension_values.md
│   └── metrics_by_group/*.md
├── kb/
│   ├── business_kb.md
│   ├── dm.md
│   ├── messaging_support.md
│   ├── platform_terms.md
│   ├── story.md
│   └── ur.md
└── custom_rules/
```

The builder package includes this seeded live knowledge so that a new user starts with a usable social KB instead of an empty userdata layer.

## Read / Write Responsibility | 读写职责

### `ab-knowledge-builder-beta`

Owns:
- writing and updating `userdata/ab-analysis-framework-beta/*`
- normalizing live knowledge content
- maintaining seeded knowledge quality over time

### `ab-analysis-framework-beta`

Owns:
- reading the live knowledge layer
- applying experiment-analysis rules
- using domain-first recall and metric interpretation logic

---

## Linkage Rule | 联动规则

This repo uses a one-way linkage rule:

- `ab-knowledge-builder-beta` is the source-of-truth editor for live knowledge content
- `ab-analysis-framework-beta` is the consumer of that knowledge layer

Update the framework skill only when one of these changes:
- the knowledge path changes
- the knowledge schema changes
- the read order changes
- new required indexes or reading categories are introduced
- analysis rules must adapt to newly stabilized knowledge conventions

Do not update the framework skill for pure knowledge-content growth by default.
